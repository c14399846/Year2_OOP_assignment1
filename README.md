Draw a line graph or otherwise(visualisation) of a dataset that you have chosen yourself. Should be able to input other datasets (use variables, little hardcoding).



This program compares 7 differnet stocks from 1997 - 2015.

Stocks: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Microsft, Amazon, Coke, Pepsi, AIG.

Their data was displayed via use of linegraphs and a piechart, to compare their prices throughout 1997-2015,
and to compare their highest volume traded (in USD) on any given day.

The graphs purpose was to be dynamic with how it displayed its data.

The y-axis (Stock Price) should change to the largest stock value that is selected, which is AIG if all stocks are chosen.
